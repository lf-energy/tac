# Annual Reviews

The purpose of the Annual Review is to gauge whether the project is still at the correct maturity stage based on the criteria for the current stage, as well as identify any concerns or feedback from the project's TSC that the {{ site.foundation_name }} can help address.

Projects will schedule their Annual Review as part of the next meeting of their primary SIG following the anniversary of the project’s acceptance; projects not affiliated with a SIG will schedule their Annual Review as part of a TAC meeting. Projects should prepare a short presentation for the Annual Review that covers the following points:

- The current activity of the project, including releases, adoption, and committer/contribution growth and diversity.
- Assessment of whether the project is fulfilling the requirements to remain at its current stage or be considered for a different stage.
- Feedback on its experience as an {{ site.foundation_name }} project, including benefits from being an {{ site.foundation_name }} project and areas that the TAC and {{ site.foundation_name }} staff can better support the project.

Projects should use the [Annual Review template]({% link process/annual_review_template.pptx %}) to structure their presentation.

Projects may request to move to the next lifecycle stage as part of their annual review. To do so, the project should notify the TAC at least two days before the TAC meeting they are scheduled to present at, adding a comment on the annual review GitHub issue. For projects that conduct their annual review as part of a SIG meeting, after the annual review at the SIG meeting, please open a [TAC meeting agenda request](https://github.com/lf-energy/tac/issues/new?template=01-tac-agenda.yml) to request that the TAC review for moving to the next lifecycle stage; requests will be shared with the TAC during the next TAC meeting, and then after an open comment period of five business days, the TAC will vote via LFX Voting.

If the TAC deems the project not meeting the current stage's requirements, it may vote to move the project to the appropriate or {{ site.archived_lifecycle_stage }} stage. The project may choose to move outside of the {{ site.foundation_name }} at any time.
