# Annual Reviews

The purpose of the Annual Review is to gauge whether the project is still at the correct maturity stage based on the criteria for the current stage, as well as identify any concerns or feedback from the project's TSC that the {{ site.foundation_name }} can help address. Projects will schedule their Annual Review as part of the next meeting of their primary SIG following the anniversary of the projectâ€™s acceptance; projects not affiliated with a SIG will schedule their Annual Review as part of a TAC meeting. 

Projects should prepare a short presentation for the Annual Review that covers the following points:

- The project's current activity, including releases, adoption, and committer/contribution growth and diversity.
- Assessment of whether the project is fulfilling the requirements to remain at its current stage or be considered for a different stage.
- Feedback on its experience as an {{ site.foundation_name }} project, including benefits from being an {{ site.foundation_name }} project and areas that the TAC and {{ site.foundation_name }} staff can better support the project.

Projects should use the [Annual Review template]({% link process/annual_review_template.pptx %}) to structure their presentation.

The TAC may consider changing the [project lifecycle stage](lifecycle) as part of the annual review; projects should notify the TAC before the meeting to request a change to their lifecycle stage. If the TAC deems the project not meeting the current stage's requirements, it may vote to move the project to the appropriate or {{ site.archived_lifecycle_stage }} stage. The project may choose to move outside of {{ site.foundation_name }} at any time.
