# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

* TOC
{:toc}

{{ site.foundation_name }} hosts several Special Interest Groups (SIGs), which serve the role of being focal points for specific topics or focus areas within the technical work happening in {{ site.foundation_name }}. Current SIG sanctioned include...

- EV Charging
- Grid Operations
- Digital Substations
- Grid Simulation and Modeling
- Data Standards and Tooling
- AI
- Archimate

## Responsibilities

SIGs are designed to foster more focused and granular discussions on specific topics related to one or more of our hosted projects. The LF staff will always support these SIGs, facilitating initial meetings and acting as advisors to them.

Specific responsibilities for SIGs include.

- Electing a Chairperson
- Holding regular meetings ( LF Staff to support )
- Coordinating annual reviews of projects
  - Only required to hold an annual review in the primary SIG the project has a liaison for.
- Making recommendations to the TAC projects that should be considered for moving to a different lifecycle stage.

## Roles 

Each SIG will have two defined roles. These roles can be held by one or more persons.

### Chairperson

The Chairperson will lead the SIG meetings, coordinate the agendas, and ensure meeting notes/recordings are taken and made available. The Chairperson will also work with the TAC Liaison to ensure the SIG functions well and help provide project support and networking opportunities.

### TAC Liaison 

The TAC Liaison is a named TAC voting member who updates the TAC on the work happening in the SIG and makes recommendations to the TAC for projects that should be considered for a different lifecycle stage. The TAC Liaison will also help escalate any items to the TAC as needed.

## Best Practices

Not all SIGs are alike, but a good SIG generally has many good patterns that should be emulated for success.

### Inclusive of hosted projects and other industry efforts

### Provides a forum for discussion and collaboration.

### Produces a functional model or architecture for the projects that are a part of the SIG.

### Identifies opportunities for new projects
