## Responsibilities

SIGs are designed to foster more focused and granular discussions on specific topics related to one or more of our hosted projects. The LF staff will always support these SIGs, facilitating initial meetings and acting as advisors.

Specific responsibilities for SIGs include.

- Electing a Chairperson
- Holding regular meetings ( LF Staff to support )
- Coordinating annual reviews of projects
  - Only required to hold an annual review in the primary SIG the project has a liaison for.
  - SIGs must follow the [annual review process]({% link process/review_cycle.md %}) but can add additional criteria specific to the SIG if they desire.
- Make recommendations for the TAC projects that should be considered for moving to a different lifecycle stage.
  - This recommendation is made by consensus or by a majority vote of SIG Representatives if a consensus cannot be reached.
 
Out-of-scope activities for SIGs include.

- Hosting a code project or developing code ( these should be proposed as LF Energy projects ).

## SIG Representatives

SIGs are open for anyone to participate in. While most decisions are made by consensus, the defined set of SIG Representatives will be listed below if a consensus cannot be reached.

- One representative from each LF Energy project primarily affiliated with the SIG.
- TAC Liasion for the SIG.
- Any other individuals approved by the majority of the then-current SIG Representatives.

SIG Representatives can be added and removed by a majority vote of the then-current SIG Representatives. They do not have to resign if their company affiliation changes.

## Roles 

Each SIG will have two defined roles. One or more persons can hold these roles.

### Chairperson

The Chairperson will lead the SIG meetings, coordinate the agendas, and ensure meeting notes/recordings are taken and made available. The Chairperson will also work with the TAC Liaison to ensure the SIG functions well and help provide project support and networking opportunities.

SIGs are recommended to adopt the Chairperson/Vice Chairperson model, in which a person serves as Vice Chairperson for one year and then Chairperson for the second year. 

### TAC Liaison 

The TAC Liaison is a named TAC voting member who updates the TAC on the work happening in the SIG and makes recommendations to the TAC for projects that should be considered for a different lifecycle stage. The TAC Liaison will also help escalate any items to the TAC as needed.

## Top-level goals for SIGs

While SIGs will establish 12-month goals to help focus the work and collaboration, the following goals apply to all SIGs and will be evaluated by the TAC annually.

- Identifying gaps, including
  - Outside projects/groups to include
  - Topics/areas where there isnâ€™t an existing solution
- Improving collaboration between projects participating in the SIG
- Defining scope and non-scope for the SIG
- Determining how to work together in the SIG effectively
