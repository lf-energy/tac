# Project Websites

{{ site.foundation_name }} allows the projects and other initiatives within {{ site.foundation_name }} to host their own websites. It is expected that the project will be responsible for managing the website content and any infrastructure required to host the website.

The following guidelines apply to these websites.

1. The website MUST have the ‘Linux Foundation Projects’ header, cookie consent integration, and legal footer. [Contact {{ site.foundation_name }} Staff]({{ site.helpdesk_url }}) if you need the code/language to include.
2. The website MUST NOT collect any personally identifiable information (PII) unless it goes through an approved LF data collection system. This means that the project can’t set up a separate Google Form for collecting PII, or have PII collected go to a system owned by a separate entity. 
3. The website MUST provide admin access to the LF. This includes any code repository used to build the site, access to a hosting provider that hosts the site, and the ability to manage the site’s content. The LF will ensure these credentials are only used for exceptional circumstances.
4. The website MUST NOT enable any third-party functionality or integrations, particularly those that collect and/or share any user-submitted data without LF approval. 
5. The domain name and DNS for the website MUST be owned by the LF and managed in LFX PCC. LF IT and PMO can easily make any adjustments on behalf of the project.
6. Ensure that the website does not bias any particular company (e.g., no links to a vendor’s products from the website, no promotions or offers). 

[Contact {{ site.foundation_name }} Staff]({{ site.helpdesk_url }}) if you have any questions or need support for the items above.
