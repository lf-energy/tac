# Resource Request Process

This document outlines the process for hosting projects to have resource requests granted. Resources could mean several different things, but the current types of requests being considered are limited to:

* Project websites
* Project demo sandbox infrastructure
* Documentation and technical writing resources/support
* Release engineering support (CI/CD optimization, build tooling, etc.)

Other requests may be considered over time.

## Request Process

Projects needing resources should aim to request funding 2-3 months before the need arises. Projects should propose funding needs for the subsequent year in September/October during budget planning.

Pending requests can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/lf-energy/projects/2/views/6)

### Project Resource Request Form

Projects should submit resource requests as [an issue in the TAC repo](https://github.com/lf-energy/tac/issues/new?template=05-resource-request.yml) to make the request.

### Request review - TAC

The TAC will review resource requests asynchronously within three business days of the initial request being made. TAC Members will have seven business days to review the request, and if there are no concerns, a vote to approve will be held via LFX Voting. 

The TAC review criteria will includeâ€¦

* Lifecycle Stage of the project: Graduated and Early Adoption Stage projects have the highest priority, Incubation Stage projects are considered after that, and Sandbox Stage projects will be considered for funding on a case-by-case basis.
* Previous funding requests for the project: With limited funds, the TAC will ensure projects have equal access to funding based on their lifecycle stage.
* Are other tools/services being provided that could be used instead? Having two of the same or similar tools/services reduces funds available for other projects and can create silos.

### Request review - Governing Board/Budget Committee

Once the TAC approves, the budget request will be shared with the Budget Committee. 

The review from the budget committee ensures that enough budget is allocated for the request. If additional funds are required, the committee will conduct a reforecast for this request and other anticipated needs, submitting the revised budget to the Governing Board for approval. 

The Budget Committee will monitor the budget for project requests and propose reforecasts to the Governing Board for approval.

### Post approval

Once approved, the LF Staff will work with the project to operationalize the resources approved.
