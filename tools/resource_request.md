# Resource Request Process

This document outlines the process for hosting projects to have resource requests granted. Resources could mean several different things, but the current types of requests being considered are limited to:

* Infrastructure needs ( website, CI/CD, communication tools, other software/hardware )

Other requests may be considered over time.

## Request Process

Projects needing resources should aim to request funding 2-3 months before the need arises. Projects should propose funding needs for the subsequent year in September/October if possible during budget planning.

### Project Resource Request Form

Projects should submit resource requests as [an issue in the TAC repo](https://github.com/lf-energy/tac/issues/new?template=05-resource-request.yml) to make the request.

### Request review - TAC

The TAC will review resource requests initially as part of its regular meeting business. The TAC review criteria will includeâ€¦

* Lifecycle Stage of the project; Graduated and Early Adoption Stage projects have the highest priority, Incubation Stage projects are considered after that, and Sandbox Stage projects will be considered for funding on a case-by-case basis.
* Previous funding requests for the project: With limited funds, the TAC will ensure projects have equal access to funding based on their lifecycle stage.
* Are other tools/services being provided that could be used instead? Having two of the same or similar tools/services reduces funds available for other projects and can create silos.

### Request review - Governing Board/Budget Committee

Once the TAC approves, the TAC chair will share the budget request with the Budget Committee. 

The main review from the budget committee is to ensure enough budget is left for the request; if more is needed, then the budget committee will do a reforecast for this request and other anticipated needs and submit it to the Governing Board for approval. 

The Budget Committee will monitor the budget for project requests and propose reforecasts to the Governing Board for approval.
