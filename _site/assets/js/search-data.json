    "content": "Ensuring a clean code pedigree and lineage is critical to the industry’s downstream adoption of open-source code. LF Energy Foundation requires the use of the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO), which is the same mechanism that the Linux® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions. The DCO is considered one of the simplest tools for sign-offs from contributors as the representations are meant to be easy to read and indicate signoff is done as a part of the commit message. Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO: . Signed-off-by: John Doe &lt;john.doe@example.com&gt; . You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using git commit -s. Useful tools to make doing DCO signoffs easier . By default, all GitHub repositories have both the GitHub DCO App installed and commit signoffs enabled. This ensures anyone contributing via the GitHub web interface will automatically sign off commits. A few options for developers working from their local machines are available to automatically signoff commits. | The DCO command line tool lets you do a single signoff for an entire repo. | Shell scripting to automatically apply signing. Here is an example for bash, to be put into a .bashrc file: | . git() { if [[ $1 == \"commit\" ]]; then shift echo \"Executing git commit -s $@\" command git commit -s \"$@\" else command git \"$@\" fi } . Signoff for commits where the DCO signoff was missed . When bringing in a code repository for the first time or commits done before the DCO checks are enabled, there would be a series of commits that don’t include the sign-off statement. You can retroactively signoff commits you’ve made by making a commit with your DCO signoff that contains a new text file (the suggested name is past_commits.txt ) with the following contents: . The following commits were made pursuant to the Developer Certificate of Origin, even though a Signed-off-by: was not included in the commit message. &lt;COMMIT HASH&gt; &lt;COMMIT MSG&gt; ... Each user who has made past commits should have their own Signed-off-by: line in the commit message. This process can be automated using the DCO Org Check script. Handling DCO errors using GitHub website commits. The Probot: DCO app requires that the email address and name specified in the DCO Signoff match that of the current information from the user making the commit. Generally, this is handled automatically when using a local git client, but when making contributions from the GitHub website directly, this needs to be aligned manually. For contributions made using the GitHub UI, ensure that the name and email listed there match that which is in your GitHub profile. ",

No fixed amount of investment, mindshare, or development contributions are allocated to specific projects. Just as open source development is based on the idea that, collectively, we are smarter than any one of us, open source foundations work to make the entire community better off. Equally important, a neutral home for a project and community fosters this type of positive-sum thinking. It drives growth and diversity, core elements of a successful open-source project. Organizations and projects come to the LF Energy Foundation to… . Have a vendor-neutral home for the project and assets. Groundbreaking and game-changing projects are a collective effort across organizations. Hosting at the LF Energy Foundation ensures a project has a reputable legal home and governance to attract contributors and adoption. | All projects are set up as 501c6 Series LLC legal entities, giving the project a non-profit status and autonomy to set their policies and processes with expert guidance. | To ensure neutral management, the project can access LF Energy Foundation-owned infrastructures such as mailing lists, websites, and domain names. | LF Energy Foundation TAC project lifecycle guides the project to establish a sustainable project. | . Bring in contributors from different organizations ( including your competitors ) . Shared R&amp;D with a broad ecosystem means bringing more contributors and maintainers into your project - including your competitors. | Our staff works with the project to establish open, neutral governance that makes roles clear and paths to leadership available. | All projects have a Code of Conduct to ensure collaboration in a safe and welcoming environment. | Outreach through the LF Energy Foundation is done from a neutral perspective, separating product promotion and vendor favoritism and promoting the community’s work. | . Drive broad industry awareness with the press and analysts. Your project will get broad motion picture, visual effects, tech, and open source exposure through our large audience, extensive media outreach partnerships with publications such as Linux.com and TFiR, and key partners. | Your project will be featured on the LF Energy Foundation and the Linux Foundation websites. | Always available guest blog post(s) on the LF Energy Foundation blog on project updates. | Post one technical article about an open-source project you care about to Linux.com, which has over 1 million unique visitors per month. | As appropriate, support your announcements with social outreach and quotes from Linux Foundation and LF Energy Foundation leadership. | Access to opportunities for contributed articles, videos, podcasts, and events | . Build a downstream ecosystem for open and commercial solutions. Sustainable projects are those the industry adopts and drive economic value with. Doing this at LF Energy Foundation takes advantage of the expertise in building these programs. | Conformance programs with community requirements that the LF Energy Foundation projects manage. | Training and certification programs through LF Training. | Badging using Credly to recognize individuals. | Events such as Open Source Days and Open Source Forum for the community to connect and collaborate. | . Have world-class tools for measuring project insights and success. LFX Insights is an analytics tool for all open-source projects hosted by the Linux Foundation. Its capabilities include the following: . | Getting visibility you need to remove bottlenecks at any stage of your project’s code pipeline. Drill down into performance metrics across every step in the development lifecycle to identify where you should focus your resources. | Ensuring the health and viability of the open-source projects you care about. Leverage data to help validate undertakings for investment and track the activity and growth of projects your organization is already involved in. | Showcasing your organization’s leadership and subject matter expertise in the open source community. Leverage affiliations to measure the impact of your employees’ contributions and capture the complete picture of your team’s impact | . LFX Security is a tool for managing security for your project. Its capabilities include the following: . | Monitoring your entire project for potential vulnerabilities with an aggregated project-level view of your entire software sandwich across source control systems and repositories, with the ability to remediate the found issues. | Identifying non-inclusive language and code secrets in your project to prevent embarrassing situations. | .

    "content": "Typically the TSC is comprised of the primary committers or maintainers in a project. To start there may be an appointed list, but over time more individuals may join the TSC according to the policies the TSC set for how new members are added. Regardless, TSC meetings are generally open to anyone interested unless there are sensitive issues to discuss which necessitate a private meeting. LFX Project Control Center is a tool for managing project committees and roles within a project. Each project will be setup in that tool with a voting committee named ‘Technical Steering Committee (TSC)’, notating the project chairperson and all of the voting members. Project chairpersons will have access to manage this in addition to the Linux Foundation staff supporting the project. More details on using LFX Project Control Center for committee management can be found in the LFX documentation. ",

    "content": "Generally, TSCs have a few roles to facilitate the operations of the TSC. Roles are elected by TSC voting members and term lengths are determined by the TSC. Chairperson . The TSC Chairperson is the figurehead of the project. The TSC Chairperson’s primary role is to: . | Lead all meetings of the TSC, setting the agenda with the consultation of other TSC members. | Be the public spokesperson for the project at events and in public communications ( such as PR/AR meetings, articles, and blog posts ) | Serve as a representative of the project to the TAC and other projects and entities. | . Secretary . The Secretary records all meeting notes for TSC members and ensures they are distributed to the project community after the meeting in a timely manner. Often projects have a rotating secretary role instead of a permanent role. Additional roles . TSCs often will add additional roles on an as-needed basis to manage different areas or roles within a project. TSCs can come up with the right definitions and scope for these roles, but it’s highly advised to document them to ensure expectations are aligned. Roles we’ve seen in a project include but aren’t limited to… . | Chief Architect | Security Lead | Release Manager | Documentation Lead | . ",

    "content": "TSC meetings are opportunities for the project community to come together to share updates and discuss issues and future plans. All TSC meetings are considered open to the public unless there is a sensitive issue to discuss ( in the case of private meetings, Linux Foundation staff should be present at such meetings ). It’s recommended to schedule meetings on a regular cadence ( for example, every other week at 2pm US Pacific Time ). Many project communities alternate TSC meeting times if project members are globally dispersed ( for example, one time that is US Eastern/Europe friendly and another that is US Pacific/Asia/Australia friendly ). Scheduling logistics . Using LFX Project Control Center, you can easily schedule one-off or recurring meetings that automatically send invites to TSC members, allow other interested parties to register for meetings, and record meetings and make them available for others. Additionally, it provides excellent statistics for meeting attendance which can help you assess member engagement. More details on using LFX Project Control Center for meeting management can be found in the LFX documentation. For public meetings, LFX PCC provides a public link for sharing the meeting with non-attendees so they can register for the meeting. It’s recommended to make that link available publically. Agenda . The TSC Chairperson should share an agenda at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, if possible, with an ask to share additional agenda items. Projects can share via the public discussion lists or using a pull request on GitHub. ",

    "content": "Q: Is a TSC member required to have their employer be a member of the Open Mainframe Project? . A: No - All technical community work, such as projects and working groups, are open to anyone to participate and not bound by membership in the Open Mainframe Project. Q: Does a person lose their membership in a TSC if they leave or change employers? . A: No - TSC membership is bound to an individual and not an organization. If the change of employment for a TSC member results in a key contributing organization having a lack of TSC representation, the TSC may choose to invite a new TSC member affiliated with that organization, provided that that person meets any requirements set for TSC membership. Q: Does an individual serving on the TSC represent themselves, the project, and/or their employer? . A: As TSC members are individuals within the context of a TSC, it’s expected that all their actions are for the general good of the project itself. It’s not appropriate to use the project for anti-competitive purposes, nor is it appropriate to discuss a TSC member employer’s product plans and roadmap in conjunction with the project planning. ",
