Emeritus projects have contributed to the ecosystem, but are not necessarily recommended for modern development as there may be more actively maintained choices. LF Energy appreciates the contributions of these projects and their communities, and the role they have played in moving the ecosystem forward.</p> <p>Projects in this stage are not in active development. Their maintainers may infrequently monitor their repositories, and may only push updates to address security issues, if at all. Emeritus projects should clearly state their status and what any user or contributor should expect in terms of response or support. If there is an alternative project the maintainers recommend, it should be listed as well. The foundation will continue to hold the IP and any trademarks and domains, but the project does not draw on foundation resources.</p> <h3 id="acceptance-criteria-3"> <a href="#acceptance-criteria-3" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="acceptance-criteria-3"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Acceptance Criteria </h3> <p>Projects may be granted Emeritus status via a 2/3 vote from the TAC and with approval from project ownership.

This review will gauge whether the project is still at the correct maturity stage based on the criteria for the current stage.</p> <p>Projects will schedule their annual review as part of the next TAC meeting following the anniversary of the project’s acceptance. Projects should prepare a short presentation that covers the following points, which the TAC will use in its review of the project:</p> <ul> <li>The current activity of the project, including releases, adoption, and committer/contribution growth and diversity.</li> <li>The project’s functional architecture that is built out in the <a href="http://architecture.lfenergy.org/">LF Energy ArchiMate tool</a>, which should be current.</li> <li>Assessment of whether the project is fulfilling the requirements for the project to remain at its current stage, or be considered for a different stage</li> <li>Feedback on its experience as an LF Energy project, including benefits from being an LF Energy project and areas that the TAC and LFE staff can better support the project.</li> </ul> <p>Projects can use the template <a href="https://wiki.lfenergy.org/download/attachments/14084913/Template for Annual Review at LF Energy Foundation TAC Meeting.pptx?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1688671742511&amp;api=v2">here</a> for this presentation.</p> <p>Annual reviews require a majority affirmative vote of the TAC for the project to continue at the current stage or the appropriate number of votes to move to the next stage. If the TAC deems the project not to be currently meeting the requirements of the current stage, it may vote to move the project to the appropriate stage or Emeritus stage. The project may choose to move outside of the LFE at any time.</p> <h1 id="transition"> <a href="#transition" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="transition"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Transition </h1> <p>The TAC is expected to review all projects during their next review cycle based on the criteria for each stage and the process as defined in this document.</p> <p>Any projects on the TAC with a voting seat prior to this lifecycle taking effect will retain a voting seat unless they move to Emeritus status.</p> </main> <hr> <footer> <p><a href="#top" id="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p> <p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Copyright &copy; The Linux Foundation&reg;.
