# Proposal: Adopt SBOM + Sigstore + SWHID for All Releases Across LF Energy Projects

In this [recent and insightful post from Mike Dolan](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelkdolan_opensource-cybersecurity-activity-7382412809453723648-CHfd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEB-KLQB8OFyT2PtR11cYpzvvm0C1XU8xR8), he outlines how SBOMs and cryptographic signatures can be systematically associated with binary releases. Building on this direction, this proposal recommends extending that practice across **all LF Energy projects** — and adding a third, complementary element: the SoftWare Hash IDentifier (SWHID).

Together, these three mechanisms — **SBOM (SPDX), Sigstore signatures, and SWHID** — ensure complete transparency, verifiable provenance, and long-term preservation for every release.

## ✅ Standards and Recommended Implementations

**1. SBOM — SPDX (ISO/IEC 5962)**
SPDX is the recognized international standard for representing a Software Bill of Materials.

**2. Signatures — Sigstore**
Sigstore provides identity-based, short-lived cryptographic signatures stored in an immutable transparency log.

**3. Source Preservation — SWHID (ISO/IEC 18670)**
SWHIDs provide a permanent, content-based identifier linked to a specific revision archived by Software Heritage.

## ✅ Why This Matters

### 1. SBOM – *Know What’s Inside*

An SBOM offers:

* Transparency on dependencies and licensing
* Faster vulnerability and compliance analysis
* Alignment with regulatory frameworks (EU CRA, NIS2, US EO 14028, etc.)
* Easier long-term maintenance

**It answers:** *What exactly is in this release?*

### 2. Sigstore – *Trust the Source*

Sigstore modernizes signing practices by eliminating private key silos and tying signatures to verified identities.

It guarantees:

* Authenticated authorship
* Tamper detection
* Public record via Rekor
* CI/CD-native integration

**It answers:** *Who built this, and has it remained intact?*

### 3. SWHID – *Preserve It Forever*

SWHIDs connect a release to its exact source code, archived independently of any platform.

This enables:

* Immutable long-term reference
* Reproducibility and citation
* Protection against repository loss or rewriting
* FAIR/Open Science and Digital Commons alignment

**It answers:** *Where is the exact source, even in 20 years?*

## ✅ The Power of Combining All Three

Using SBOM + Sigstore + SWHID delivers end-to-end provenance:

| Aspect       | Question Solved                          | Mechanism   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Composition  | What is in the release?                  | SBOM (SPDX) |
| Authenticity | Who built it and is it unchanged?        | Sigstore    |
| Permanence   | Where is the definitive historical copy? | SWHID       |

**Combined, they offer:**

* Complete provenance (what + who + where + when)
* Regulatory and contractual readiness
* Industrial and institutional trust
* Alignment with digital public goods and sovereign tech strategies

## ✅ Conclusion

Adopting these three elements across LF Energy projects would make releases:

* **Auditable** – compliant with security and policy requirements
* **Verifiable** – cryptographically traceable over time
* **Reproducible** – resilient to platform or repo changes
* **Credible** – enterprise- and government-grade

This is no longer optional: it reflects the emerging baseline for responsible open-source distribution in 2026 and beyond.

I would be happy to help define a minimal implementation roadmap or template for all LF Energy repositories.
