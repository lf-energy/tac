    to furthering the goal of building decarbonization. The NODE Collective has already
    amassed the most complete, well-structured, and accurate set of incentive data
    in the U.S. It has developed the tools to enlist a broad coalition in this effort
    moving forward.


    The Challenge: Fragmented and outdated electrification incentive data are major
    barriers to progress in the electrification


    Our Solution: NODE Collective introduces a vibrant, evolving data repository,
    a cornerstone of reliable and up-to-date electrification information, energized
    by:


    Proactive Data Collection: dedicated submission channels enable us to actively
    gather up-to-date and precise incentive data.


    Collaborative Updates: A network of stakeholders collaborating to maintain data
    accuracy and consistency, underpinned by structured protocols and expert review.


    Standardization of Incentive Data: By creating clear formats and guidelines, NODE
    Collective eliminates inconsistencies, facilitating streamlined data exchange.


    The Foundation for Impact:

    NODE Collective''s data repository will set the gold standard for tracking electrification
    incentives, laying a solid foundation for informed decisions, innovative tools,
    and insightful policy development.'
