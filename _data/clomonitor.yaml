  description: Grid Capacity Map is a project that aims to give customers and stakeholders
    public information about grid capacity and grid connection costs in different
    locations. The purpose is to give an early indication to customers that want to
    connect to the grid and to ensure customer and stakeholders expectations on-grid
    connections are realistic to give a better connection experience with fewer surprises
    for both grid owner (DSO/TSO),  grid customers, and other stakeholders.

  description: 'A nonprofit alliance founded by the Building Decarbonization Coalition,

    (NODE) Collective will source, structure, and maintain data on every incentive
    program in the nation, and make it open and accessible to all who are committed
    to furthering the goal of building decarbonization. The NODE Collective has already
    amassed the most complete, well-structured, and accurate set of incentive data
    in the U.S. It has developed the tools to enlist a broad coalition in this effort
    moving forward.


    The Challenge: Fragmented and outdated electrification incentive data are major
    barriers to progress in the electrification


    Our Solution: NODE Collective introduces a vibrant, evolving data repository,
    a cornerstone of reliable and up-to-date electrification information, energized
    by:


    Proactive Data Collection: dedicated submission channels enable us to actively
    gather up-to-date and precise incentive data.


    Collaborative Updates: A network of stakeholders collaborating to maintain data
    accuracy and consistency, underpinned by structured protocols and expert review.


    Standardization of Incentive Data: By creating clear formats and guidelines, NODE
    Collective eliminates inconsistencies, facilitating streamlined data exchange.


    The Foundation for Impact:

    NODE Collective''s data repository will set the gold standard for tracking electrification
    incentives, laying a solid foundation for informed decisions, innovative tools,
    and insightful policy development.'
